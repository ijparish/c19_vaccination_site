# Vaccine Clinic Information and Scheduling System

Welcome to the Vaccine Clinic Information and Scheduling System (VCISS
for short)! This document will serve as a guide for an initial user
to set up an account in our server and schedule an appointment for
a COVID-19 vaccination.

## Getting started

To use the VCISS site, first navigate to http://localhost:8000
(this allows you to access the server that's been set up on your 
local machine via the README.md file instructions). This will take
you to the home page. 

## Creating an account

In order to schedule a vaccination appointment, you must have
created an account and registered with our system. To do that: 

* first navigate to the "Sign Up" link in the navigation bar atop the home 
page (this nav bar is also available throughout the site!). 

* Once there, please enter your custom username, a valid email address, phone number, and a password of your choosing in the appropriate fields and click "Submit"!

* Once your account has been successfully created, you will be redirected to 
the Login page. 

## Logging In
---

If you have just created an account, you will have been redirected to the Login page. If not, you can access it by clicking "Login" on the nav bar at the top of 
the site.

* Enter your username, email address, and password associated with your account.
* Select the "Login" button

It's that simple! If your information was entered correctly, and you have an
account, you will be logged in and redirected to your User Information page.

## User Information
---

If you are already logged in, you may access your User Information page by 
selecting "Login" from the nav bar at the top of the site. All information associated with your account (except, of course, your password!) will be displayed, including:
* Username
* Email
* Phone number
* Scheduled appointments (if there are none, you do not have an apointment!)

## Clinic Search
---

To navigate to the Clinic Search page, you may click the "Visit Vaccine Finder" 
button on the site's home page, or you may select "Clinics" from the nav bar
at the top of the site.


To find a vaccination clinic that best suits your needs, please use the filter on the page to narrow the results to clinics relevant to you. 

* Once you've selected the best filter options for you, select the "Search" button.

    * You may also select "Reset" to reset all filter options and start fresh!

* If available, you will be presented with the clinic options ( in the form of handy little cards) that best suit your needs.

## Scheduling an appointment
---

To schedule an appointment, you must have first used the Clinic Search feature to
find the clinics most relevant to you.

* Your search results will be displayed in the form of cards -- each card will have a "Schedule" button. Select the button to view a list of appointment times.


    * <b>Important Note:</b> You must be logged in to an existing account to schedule an appointment for any clinic! If you are not, the "Schedule" button as described above will be disabled.

* You will be directed to the scheduling page for that clinic, and be presented with a list of available appointment times. Select the time that best works for you.

* If the time is still available, you will be presented with a confirmation page 
that outlines your appointment time, and the clinic at which you have scheduled 
your appointment. 

    * If it has become unavailable while you made your decision, you will be presented with an information page, and be encouraged to find another time.

## Cancelling an appointment
---
To cancel an appointment, you must navigate to your User Information page (as covered in the User Information section). If you have scheduled an appointment, 
that appointment information will be available to you on your User Information page.

* To cancel your appointment, simply click on the "Cancel" button beneath the appointment information
